For security reasons, there is a ranking designation that is assigned when the user is first created. A user's rank can be changed at any time. However, when creating or updating a user's rank certain restrictions apply. A user cannot update or create a user of equal or greater rank than them. This means that a person of the lowest rank cannot create or edit any users. Another example would be a user of rank #3 could create a user of rank #4 or #5 (lower) but NOT #3, #2, or #1.</p>

                        <p>The restrictions that must be allowed to complete the configuration are pictured to the right. Namely, for the configuration the "iTunes Store" and Installing-apps is required to add the barcode scanner and add a link to the home screen. For continued use of the app, access to Safari is required.</p>
                        <p>In Safari, go to the Maintenance Site login page. Hit the "page options" button and select "Save to Home Screen." Name the link "Maintenance" and save it. Drag the new app "Maintenance" to the dock.</p>
                        <p>Open "App Store" and search for "ZXing" pronounced "Zebra Crossing." This is an open source QR Code Reader app. Since there is no way for a web based app to directly use the camera, a proxy is used. If ZXing ceases to be the best app available it can be easily changed in the code (It's only one line of code to open the app). Install the app and make accessible to the user.</p>

You may also use your browsers "back" button, but be careful when going back to certain pages like creating users, or machines. You don't want to accidentally make them twice.</p>
                        <p>The most useful to you will be the "Dashboard." When you click on the logo in the upper left corner the Dashboard will slide out from the side of the screen. This sidebar displays pages, on which, the content is tailored to your assigned work area, and job title. Pretty cool, eh? From here you can see the machines that are associated with you, your homepage with maintenance requests associated with you, and an inbox of messages from other users.</p>

                    	<p>"QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response Code) is the trademark for a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed for the automotive industry in Japan. A barcode is an optically machine-readable label that is attached to an item and that records information related to that item. The information encoded by a QR code may be made up of four standardized types ("modes") of data (numeric, alphanumeric, byte / binary, kanji) or, through supported extensions, virtually any type of data." –Wikipedia (Best source ever)</p>
                        <p>There are several advantages to using QR Codes vs. traditional barcodes. The most important being that they can be scanned optically, that is, by any computer with a camera, rather than with an expensive laser scanner. Therefore, there should be no additional overhead for Scanners. The codes can also still be read if obscured depending on the level or redundancy in the encoding. The Toyota subsidiary Denso Wave trademarked "QR Codes" the name, but the technology behind it is completely open source and free to use. Last important feature about QR Codes is that they can encode many types of data and on a smart device they can actually DO different things. For example:</p>
